Lab Exercise 1.1: Grade book

Idea is to create two dictionaries:
    1. students [-> where a key is the students index -> where a value is his Name Surname]
    2. subjects [-> where a key is the students index -> where a value is a dictionary of Subjects with grades]

When reading a line the adequate indexes for the words are:
    0-Name, 1-Surname, 2-Index, 3-Subject, 4-1kol, 5-2kol, 6-lab
